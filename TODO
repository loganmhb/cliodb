- Make NodeStore use private to DurableTree, if possible
- Fix compile errors caused by upgrading cdrs
- Make InteriorNode and LeafNode different types to enforce invariants on add_leaf & persist
- Implement rebuild_with_novelty
- Write some tests that use the FFI (maybe via Hypothesis?)
- Smart query planning
-- Separate query handling into parser, query AST, query (query is query AST with idents inlined)
-- Plan queries with fetch, join, lookup instead of always doing lookups
